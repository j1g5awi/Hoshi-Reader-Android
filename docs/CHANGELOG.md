## [Unreleased]

## [v1.3.2] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Add the option to create a new shelf while moving one or more selected books.
- Add a Reader image gallery, true table-of-contents chapter ranges, and optional
  current-chapter progress in Reader chrome and statistics.
- Add a configurable daily statistics reset time and pause reading statistics
  while Reader sheets or fullscreen images are open.
- Add optional current-book cover publishing for the Android lock screen and a
  fixed PNG file used by compatible E-ink sleep-screen tools, plus direct
  integration with iReader’s built-in Book Cover screen saver on compatible
  domestic and Musnap overseas firmware using standard PNG output, with Fit,
  Fill, and Stretch scaling modes.

### Changed

- Expand Sasayaki delay adjustment to -4...4 seconds and playback speed to
  0.5...3x.
- Rename the Reader Go to panel to Contents, order its tabs as Chapters,
  Highlights, Gallery, and Search, and remove overscroll deformation from
  scrolling surfaces throughout the app.

### Fixed

- Keep Reader progress, search, and Sasayaki character offsets stable around
  numeric HTML entities, and keep lookup sentence expansion and recursive
  expression-tag scanning within the selected text boundary.
- Keep manual bookshelf sync from rebuilding the entire shelf, while refreshing
  imported reading progress in place.
- Keep large bookshelves smooth during repeated scrolling by reusing
  size-appropriate persistent cover thumbnails instead of decoding original
  covers again after they leave memory, while recovering from transient
  generation failures or damaged thumbnail-cache entries without hiding valid
  covers.
- Remember the selected Contents and Sasayaki tabs for the current Reader
  session, and keep Sasayaki on the current tab after importing an audiobook.
- Keep VN lookups and mined Anki sentences complete when a word or sentence
  continues onto a later screen.
- Keep Anki audio, book covers, Sasayaki clips, and dictionary media from
  overwriting different exported media by using content-specific filenames.
- Keep dictionary definitions in the configured dictionary order when an
  inflected lookup merges multiple deinflection candidates.
- Keep Sasayaki jumps to cues in the previous chapter from counting the target
  chapter in the current reading session when image holding is enabled.

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Add a Reader Appearance setting for top safe area height.

### Changed

- Improve dictionary lookup and import behavior by honoring Yomitan term scores
  and normalizing Japanese iteration marks, full-width numbers, and emphatic
  sequences.
- Raise Statistics daily goal limits to 200,000 characters and 12 hours.

### Fixed

- Keep the Statistics tab visible after enabling it and switching away from Settings.
- Refresh Statistics by-book covers when changing calendar ranges.
- Keep Reader lookup highlights from expanding to an entire ruby annotation when
  selecting a shorter word inside it.
- Keep VN vertical text from jumping to a new column immediately after a ruby
  annotation.
- Keep long-pressed Reader volume keys paging or seeking Sasayaki instead of
  falling back to system volume changes after the first press.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Add a full-library Statistics tab with habit summaries, calendar range browsing, per-book distribution, daily and weekly goals, and an Advanced Statistics visibility switch.

### Changed

- Open the Reader Go to panel on Chapters by default, order its tabs as Chapters, Highlights, and Search, and focus the search field when Search is selected.

### Fixed

- Prefer exact expression-and-reading local audio matches before falling back to reading-only or expression-only entries.
- Read Sasayaki M4B title, author, and cover metadata from MP4 atoms when Android's platform metadata reader returns empty.
- Improve VN reader media screens, first-highlight display, vertical layout, punctuation wrapping, and lookup and Sasayaki highlight alignment.
- Keep VN and continuous vertical reader content aligned to the configured vertical padding instead of the bottom overlap area.
- Prevent reader lookups from crashing on words that begin with supplementary-plane kanji such as 𠮟.
- Keep Sasayaki image hold active while viewing fullscreen Reader images, and avoid repeated holds once the continuous Reader target image is already visible.
