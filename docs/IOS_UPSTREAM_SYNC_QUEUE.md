# iOS Upstream Sync Queue

This document tracks open Android work after checking iOS upstream `develop`.

- Source: `reference/Hoshi-Reader-iOS`
- Baseline for this refresh: `24e356f00cfc3b74675d5610d2ffeeb52516301c`
- Latest checked: `origin/develop` at `c31c9d0ce376ff83bf6a91d908bf9f8e0fb4947b`
- Checked on: 2026-08-01
- Upstream history note: `develop` was force-updated. The previous tip
  `24e356f00cfc3b74675d5610d2ffeeb52516301c` is no longer an ancestor of the
  current tip; its project-only commit has no Android action. All commits newly
  reachable from the current `develop` tip were audited against Android code.

## Current Queue

### 1. Dictionary categories, Kanji dictionaries, and complete pitch data

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `9eff7dd` - add an excluded dictionary category.
- `67fc9e8` - add basic Kanji dictionary import, lookup, and popup rendering.
- `3cd8294` - support string pitch patterns plus nasal and devoice indicators.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- This is the native bridge and stored-dictionary foundation for later Anki
  template work. Land the bridge/data model before UI and template consumers.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- Term dictionaries can be categorized as monolingual, bilingual, excluded, or
  uncategorized. Excluded dictionaries stay installed but do not participate in
  term lookup.
- Yomitan Kanji dictionaries are imported, configured, queried for a selected
  character, and rendered as Kanji readings and meanings in the popup.
- Pitch entries accept numeric downsteps or explicit high/low strings and render
  nasal and devoiced mora indicators without losing dictionary attribution.

Android current gap:

- `DictionaryType` and `DictionaryConfig` in
  `app/src/main/java/moe/antimony/hoshi/dictionary/DictionaryModels.kt` expose
  only Term, Frequency, and Pitch and have no dictionary category or Kanji list.
- `DictionaryNativeBridge` and `DictionaryLookupQueryService` in
  `app/src/main/java/moe/antimony/hoshi/dictionary/` pass only term/frequency/
  pitch paths and expose no Kanji query API. The current query service already
  serializes rebuilds and atomically swaps sessions, so `47b0bba` is covered;
  the remaining gap is bridge capability and its consumers.
- `app/src/main/java/de/manhhao/hoshi/HoshiDicts.kt` and the tracked
  `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge` model pitch positions as `IntArray` and
  expose neither nasal/devoice metadata nor Kanji results.
- `LookupPopupHtml.kt` and `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/popup/popup.js` consume
  only `pitchPositions`; `DictionaryView.kt` has no category or Kanji sections.

Suggested slice:

- Update the tracked Kotlin/JNI bridge and ABI tests first, then extend import
  summaries, storage/config/profile backup compatibility, and query sessions.
- Add category and Kanji management UI through the existing dictionary
  repository/ViewModel boundary.
- Extend popup JSON and JS/CSS for Kanji entries and the final pitch schema.

Validation:

- Import term, frequency, pitch, and Kanji Yomitan archives; toggle, reorder,
  delete, back up, and restore each type.
- Confirm excluded dictionaries disappear from lookup without being deleted and
  category-aware config survives profile switching and iOS-compatible backup.
- Validate numeric/string pitch patterns, nasal/devoice markers, duplicate pitch
  suppression, Kanji lookup, dark/e-ink themes, and dictionary media.

### 2. Multiple Anki card formats and advanced handlebars

Status: pending Android sync; depends on dictionary categories and final popup
payloads from queue item 1.

Commits:

- `119fb5b` - advanced Anki settings and monolingual/bilingual definitions.
- `bd85c9b` - multiple named card formats.
- `c943171`, `395218a` - show-notes action and its Anki-owned setting.
- `8464a2c` - cloze prefix/body/suffix handlebars and precise sentence cloze.
- `f1bc74b` - pitch-accent graph handlebars.
- `2c86ed6` - brief/no-dictionary monolingual and bilingual variants.
- `47683d9` - guard against deleted card formats.
- `2702e31` - disable mining when the first field is not configured and handle a
  disconnected AnkiConnect backend.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- Mining configuration and output are a single user workflow. Implementing the
  storage model, popup format selection, and renderer together avoids formats
  that can be selected but cannot produce valid notes.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- Users can keep up to six named/icon card formats, each with its own deck, note
  type, field mappings, and tags; legacy single-format config migrates to a
  default format.
- Popup mining exposes every valid format, tolerates deleted formats, disables
  mining if a format's first note field is unmapped, and can open existing notes
  unless the action is disabled.
- Advanced mappings include configurable selected-glossary fallback,
  monolingual/bilingual definitions and their variants, cloze parts, and pitch
  graph handlebars.

Android current gap:

- `AnkiSettings` in `AnkiModels.kt` stores one deck, note type, mapping map, and
  tag string. `AnkiView.kt` edits that single format and has no format list,
  selected-glossary fallback, advanced handlebar visibility, or show-notes
  preference.
- `AnkiHandlebarRenderer` lacks monolingual/bilingual, cloze-part, and pitch
  graph handlebars. The popup payload has no category-aware glossary data or
  pitch graph HTML.
- `AnkiUiState.isConfigured` in `AnkiViewModel.kt` checks only selected deck and
  note type, not whether the first note field is mapped.
- `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/popup/popup.js` has one mine button per entry and
  no format identifier or show-notes bridge. `AnkiRepository.mineEntry()` mines
  only the single stored configuration.

Suggested slice:

- Add a versioned, backward-compatible format list to the DataStore-backed Anki
  repository and migrate the current fields into one default format.
- Add format management and advanced mapping UI with localized strings, then
  pass format IDs through popup mining and duplicate/show-note actions.
- Extend payload generation and renderer tests for every new handlebar and
  selected-glossary fallback rule.

Validation:

- Migrate existing single-format settings, add/edit/delete/reorder formats, and
  restart the app with all formats intact.
- Mine through AnkiConnect and AnkiDroid using different formats, unmapped first
  fields, deleted formats, disconnected backends, duplicates, media, cloze
  offsets, category fallbacks, and pitch graphs.

### 3. Reader furigana reveal mode

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `15d4a6e` - add Off, Toggle, and Hidden furigana modes.
- `23e0764` - migrate the legacy hide-furigana preference.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- This is a self-contained reader setting, but it touches shared selection and
  all reader modes, so its state and tap semantics should land together.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- Off shows furigana normally. Hidden removes it. Toggle initially hides ruby
  annotations with a dotted base-text indicator and reveals one ruby annotation
  when tapped without opening lookup for that tap.
- Existing hide-furigana users migrate to the equivalent final mode.

Android current gap:

- `ReaderSettings` stores only `hideFurigana: Boolean`; `ReaderAppearanceView.kt`
  exposes a switch rather than a three-state mode.
- `ReaderContentStyles.kt` removes/hides ruby globally and shared
  `selection.js` has no `ruby.furigana-hidden` reveal tap result. Paginated,
  continuous, and VN therefore cannot reveal individual annotations.

Suggested slice:

- Replace the boolean with a compatible enum migration, add the segmented
  setting, and implement the same reveal marker and tap interception through the
  shared reader selection/text semantics used by all modes.

Validation:

- Verify Off/Toggle/Hidden in paginated, continuous, and VN modes, horizontal
  and vertical writing, with lookup, highlights, Sasayaki, restore, and ruby
  split across styled nodes.

### 4. Reader paginated paragraph splitting and explicit font readiness

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `eb86431` - split paragraphs that span pages so native selection remains
  visible.
- `ff86caa` - explicitly load the selected reader font before layout/restore.
- `c31c9d0` - handle ruby, empty elements, and boundary edge cases in paragraph
  splitting.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- Both changes stabilize the geometry used by pagination, native selection,
  progress, and restore. Font readiness must be established before fragment
  boundaries are calculated.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- Paginated paragraphs spanning multiple columns are split into layout-neutral
  fragments at measured page boundaries, preserving ruby and empty/replaced
  elements and keeping justified fragments visually correct.
- The selected custom font is explicitly requested and awaited before splitting,
  node-offset construction, initial restore, or fragment jumps.

Android current gap:

- `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-paginated.js` has native-selection
  scroll locking but no `splitPoints`/paragraph fragmentation equivalent, so a
  selection spanning a CSS-column boundary can still be created outside the
  visible column.
- Paginated and continuous scripts await `document.fonts.ready`, but do not call
  `document.fonts.load()` for the computed body family. Imported fonts are
  injected by `ReaderContentStyles.kt`, so passive readiness may not force the
  selected face to load before restore measurements.

Suggested slice:

- Add a shared font-await helper and a paginated-only fragmenter after a focused
  Android WebView geometry design. Keep offsets compatible with
  `reader-dom-text.js`, highlights, and Sasayaki rather than copying Swift glue.

Validation:

- Long-press native selection across page boundaries in horizontal/vertical
  writing with ruby, inline elements, empty spans, images, justified text, and
  custom fonts.
- Verify page count, progress, lookup offsets, highlights, font switching,
  chapter jumps, and bookmark restore before and after fragmentation.

### 5. Sasayaki import, playback ranges, media controls, and MP3 mining clips

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `947898c` - export mined Sasayaki sentence audio as MP3.
- `4a5cfde` - honor the command-center skip-control preference.
- `a9a0747` - accept MP4 audiobooks and TXT subtitle files.
- `d7fe3f2` - raise delay to -4...4 seconds and speed to 0.5...3x.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- These changes share import validation, Media3 playback, persisted playback
  values, notification/session commands, and Anki media export.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- Sasayaki accepts `.srt` or `.txt` subtitle files and `.mp3`, `.m4b`, or `.mp4`
  audiobooks.
- Delay spans -4 to +4 seconds; playback speed spans 0.5x to 3x.
- When skip controls are enabled, external previous/next commands seek by the
  configured skip interval; otherwise they move by cue.
- Mined sentence clips are broadly compatible MP3 files with MP3 filenames.

Android current gap:

- `ImportFileType.SasayakiSubtitle` accepts only `srt`, while
  `SasayakiAudiobook` and `SasayakiAudioRepository` accept only `mp3`/`m4b`.
- `SasayakiSheet.kt` uses -2...2 delay and a 0.5...2.0 speed range.
- `SasayakiPlaybackServiceRuntime.previousFromSession()`/`nextFromSession()`
  always move by cue; `readerSkipButtonAction` affects Reader buttons but not the
  MediaSession command path.
- `SasayakiCueAudioExporter` transcodes to AAC/ADTS and names output `.aac`, not
  MP3. Current content-hashed Anki filenames are otherwise already correct.

Suggested slice:

- Expand SAF type validation and storage extension handling, then update
  normalized persisted ranges and MediaSession command routing.
- Choose an Android-supported MP3 encoding path only after checking current
  Media3/Android media guidance; preserve failure handling and background
  playback ownership in the existing MediaSessionService.

Validation:

- Import and play every accepted subtitle/audio extension through SAF; reject
  unsupported content without losing the previous source.
- Exercise min/max speed and delay, cue/seconds skip modes from Reader, headset,
  notification, and system controls, and verify persistence after restart.
- Mine clips through AnkiDroid and AnkiConnect and verify valid MP3 playback,
  MIME type, hashed filenames, and sentence range expansion.

### 6. Bookshelf cover privacy and fallback artwork

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `c6b29c8` - show title/author fallback artwork when no cover exists.
- `1db2cd3` - add Show, Blur, and Hide cover modes.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- The fallback and privacy modes affect every local/remote/shelf preview cover
  and should reuse the existing shared Coil/thumbnail-store boundary.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- A deterministic gradient card with title and optional author replaces the gray
  placeholder when a book has no real cover.
- Bookshelf and shelf-management surfaces can show, blur, or hide covers.

Android current gap:

- `BookshelfSettings` stores only sort and Reading Shelf visibility; there is no
  cover mode.
- `BookCoverCard()` in `BookshelfView.kt` renders a gray box for missing covers
  and has no title/author input. `BookMetadata` does not store author, and
  `EpubBook` does not expose parsed author metadata.

Suggested slice:

- Add optional author metadata compatibly during import/parse, then add a
  deterministic Compose fallback and cover-mode setting applied to all cover
  consumers.

Validation:

- Missing-cover books with/without authors, legacy metadata, local/remote books,
  collapsed shelf previews, multi-select, Show/Blur/Hide, dark/e-ink themes.

### 7. Lookup popup two-column layout and visual sizing

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `ed25036` - masonry layout and popup visual redesign.
- `8d1442e` - add Yomitan danger/success theme variables.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- This is a shared popup asset/settings slice used by Reader, Dictionary tab,
  and Process Text. Land persistence and bootstrap values before JS/CSS layout.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- Dictionary settings add a Two-Column Layout toggle. Multi-dictionary glossary
  cards use masonry/two-column layout when enabled and keep one column otherwise.
- Popup cards, padding, theme accents, and definition image canvas sizing match
  the refreshed design; popup height can reach 800.

Android current gap:

- `DictionarySettings`/repository and `DictionaryView.kt` have no
  `twoColumnLayout` setting.
- `LookupPopupHtml.kt` injects compact glossary and pitch options but no two-
  column flag. `popup.js` has no masonry/ResizeObserver path, uses
  `maxCanvasSize = 128`, and `popup.css` lacks the refreshed cards and danger/
  success variables.
- `ReaderAppearanceView.kt` still constrains popup height to 500.

Suggested slice:

- Add profile-aware setting persistence and bootstrap injection, port the final
  asset behavior while preserving Android bridge calls, and raise the height
  range with focused tests.

Validation:

- Reader, Dictionary tab, recursive lookup, and Process Text with one/multiple
  dictionaries, collapsed sections, long glossaries, images, mining/audio
  buttons, dark/e-ink themes, reduced motion, and outside dismissal.
- Run `node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs`, focused settings tests,
  localization tests, and lint.

### 8. Reader route open-failure fallback

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `53fdb72` - show a closeable book-open failure view.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- This is a small route reliability slice independent of reader runtime work.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- If loading cannot produce a Reader view, show a neutral full-screen
  "Couldn't open book" state with a Close action that dismisses Reader.

Android current gap:

- `ReaderRouteStateHolder.load()` returns raw localized exception text such as
  `Book not found.` through `ReaderRouteLoadState.Error`.
- `ReaderRouteDestination()` renders only `Text(state.message)` and offers no
  Close action through the normal `onClose` route path.

Suggested slice:

- Use localized generic error UI and the same close path as reader chrome, with
  state/render tests for missing and unparsable books.

Validation:

- Missing/corrupt book, working Close, normal Reader open/close, Android Back,
  bookshelf state preservation, and bookmark refresh.

### 9. Google Drive timeout and automatic-refresh error suppression

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `4dae37c` - use 10-second Drive timeouts and suppress transient automatic
  refresh errors.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- This belongs behind the existing Drive data-source/repository boundary and is
  independent of reader work.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- OAuth and Drive requests time out after 10 seconds. Automatic remote bookshelf
  refresh suppresses offline, timeout, and connection-lost failures while
  explicit user operations still report failures.

Android current gap:

- `DeviceCodeDriveAuthorizer` uses 15 seconds; `GoogleDriveClient` uses 15-second
  connect and 30-second read timeouts.
- `BookshelfViewModel.isOfflineRemoteLoadError()` suppresses only the normalized
  no-internet message, not socket/read timeout or connection-lost IO failures.

Suggested slice:

- Normalize transient failures at the Drive boundary using current Android
  networking guidance; suppress them only for automatic refresh and test manual
  operation errors separately.

Validation:

- Automatic refresh offline, slow token/list requests, and connection loss;
  manual connect/refresh/import/export/delete must still show actionable errors.

### 10. Reader WebView line-box CSS parity

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `bdf71a6` - remove the WebKit line-box property.

Dependency/value reasoning:

- Small independent layout parity change, but it needs device validation across
  writing modes and replaced elements.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- Reader CSS no longer sets
  `-webkit-line-box-contain: block glyphs replaced;`.

Android current gap:

- `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader.css` still sets the property and
  `ReaderSettingsTest` explicitly preserves it.

Suggested slice:

- Remove it only after Android WebView comparison, then update tests to assert
  the final CSS behavior.

Validation:

- Paginated/continuous horizontal and vertical writing, ruby, cover and
  multi-image pages, line height, progress, and restore.

## Covered Or No Android Action

- `4940ab7`, `6655ffd`, `3bff390`: Android now removes numeric HTML entities
  before shared matchable character counting, leaves trailing ellipses and
  periods outside the selected lookup sentence, and scopes recursive lookup to
  the active `.expr-tag`.
- `b928010`: Android now serializes original-cover derivative generation in
  `BookCoverThumbnailStore` and bounds Coil bitmap decoding in the shared
  process-wide image loader.
- `fd124d4`, `bcbef64`, `2e1c958`, `51cb994`: Android now persists the
  first-appearance Reader image inventory and TOC fragment offsets, uses one
  true TOC range for Contents/chrome/statistics, and opens Gallery items in the
  existing fullscreen viewer.
- `f403c99`, `b4e6edd`, `54fab15`: Android now persists a minute-level
  statistics reset time, uses the adjusted local date in Reader and the
  Statistics dashboard, and pauses tracking across Reader sheets and fullscreen
  images without losing the active tracking state.
- `24e356f`: orphaned Xcode project fix from the previous force-updated tip; no
  Android behavior.
- `e63cb91`, `f09664d`, `ff31274`, `262df07`, `a90a83f`, `ede061f`,
  `f5c62d8`, `6cfb7b8`, `b02da68`, `d175c93`, `9fdd19b`, `25e57c5`,
  `b43c690`, and `b41ed09`: iOS release/version metadata only.
- `98f0ef4`: merge-only history integration; its reachable behavior commits are
  classified individually above.
- `e833279`, `e7b08b8`, `1992872`, `c1e4e57`: intermediate hoshidicts bumps are
  superseded by the final dictionary behavior audited above; only the missing
  final bridge capabilities remain queued.
- `77a7eaa`, `19bd095`: iOS cleanup and unwrap removal do not define additional
  Android-visible behavior.
- `188284b`: iOS local-audio launch/actor initialization fix has no direct
  Android analogue; Android local audio is repository-backed and Media3-owned.
- `0f8a3ac`, `6a1ad82`, `c842f0a`: iOS safe-area capture/fullscreen inset
  mechanics are platform-specific. Android uses persisted top/bottom safe-area
  settings, WindowInsets, and a full-screen Compose image overlay.
- `b717c57`: iOS CSS Highlight object reuse is an implementation optimization;
  no distinct Android behavior was found.
- `5c33790`, `61a8c9d`: Android `TtuBookDataConverter.rewriteImages()` already
  resolves and normalizes relative chapter image paths before writing TTU data.
- `e1d4b3b`: `reader-media-semantics.js` already resolves promises for complete
  failed images and `onerror`, so failed images do not block Reader setup.
- `f54b55f`: Android `LocalAudioResolver` already ranks exact expression and
  reading matches first, with released behavior and tests.
- `489895d`: Android popup glossary rows already carry `data-dictionary`, and
  frequency/pitch labels use dedicated spans.
- `236ca72`: AnkiMobile callback notification timing is iOS-specific; Android
  uses AnkiDroid or AnkiConnect backends.
- `7617784`: Android shared Reader/VN tests and runtime already preserve
  cross-node Sasayaki punctuation highlighting.
- `be88af1`: Android restores previous-chapter Sasayaki cues to cue-relative
  progress through `readerProgressForCue()` and the dedicated previous-cue fix.
- `e69aee7`, `50169c0`: Android provides an always-visible, opt-in pinned Reader
  playback control row in the bottom safe area; it has no collapsible state, so
  the iOS floating control-bar expansion option needs no separate Android flag.
- `ede999c`: Android implements configurable Sasayaki image holds through shared
  reader media semantics and `ReaderSasayakiAutoPage`, including fullscreen and
  continuous-mode fixes.
- `e969056`, `83eb319`: Android cue display actions distinguish reveal requests
  from passive paused position updates and explicitly reveal the target when a
  playback/seek command resumes.
- `47b0bba`: `DictionaryLookupQueryService` serializes rebuilds and atomically
  swaps complete sessions under read/write locks, preventing stale concurrent
  rebuilds from replacing the active query.
- `89feebd`, `44f47c3`, `0da83dd`, `9f94c32`: iOS-native search field,
  autocorrection, and touch-tolerance implementation changes have no direct
  Compose/WebView parity action beyond Android's existing IME and configurable
  popup swipe handling.
